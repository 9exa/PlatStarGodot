AT LEAST MAKE SURE FUCKING QUERYING WORKS



I think imma take a break from this for now

Add support for edges with interval extremes, like when jumping to and from a
non-solid platform
Support for snapping the extremes of nodes to connect them,
this would require a  automatically creating WALK edges between them
Should WALK edges be treated differently? (i.e uneditable)
Removing nulls in edges when saving, as they would be redundant. edges are kept
as Godot::Array/vector<Edge*> for fast access and removal.
I'm considering adding 'ind' property to edge dictionary, which is why I haven't
implemented getting rid of nulls yet.
While we're at it, why not get rid of nulls in the surfaces array too?
Saving doesn't happen every frame like querying does, so it may be the ideal time for
refractoring.
Refactor() should be local to PlatGraph.cpp
Also need to start calling emit_changed there


General cleanup - everything is a mess
